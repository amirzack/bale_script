### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/order-notification-bot.git
cd order-notification-bot
```
2. Install Dependencies:
npm install

3. Set up Environment Variables
Create a .env file in the root directory and fill it with the following information:

PORT=3000
BALE_TOKEN=your-bale-token
BALE_URL=https://tapi.bale.ai
CHAT_ID="@chat_id"

TELEGRAM_TOKEN="your-telegram-token"

4. Configure WooCommerce Webhook
Go to your WordPress WooCommerce settings and create a webhook for new orders. Set the webhook to send requests to the bot URL (http://your-server-url:3000/notify-order).

üöÄ Running the Bot
Once you've set up everything, run the bot with:
npm start
The bot will start listening for incoming order notifications and will send them to your configured Telegram or Bale group.
 Notes

This bot listens for order notifications from WooCommerce and automatically sends them to Telegram or Bale based on your configuration.
Make sure your server can handle incoming requests and is exposed to the internet for the webhook to work.
Use a proxy like SOCKS5 for improved security and to avoid detection.
